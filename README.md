# Superstore Sales Dashboard
Welcome to the Superstore Sales Dashboard project! This project showcases my data analysis skills using Power BI. I have taken raw data from an Excel file, performed data cleaning, created an attractive and interactive dashboard, and even included a sales forecasting report.

# Project Highlights:

# **Data Cleaning** : I meticulously cleaned and prepared the data to ensure accuracy and reliability.

# **Interactive Dashboard** : The dashboard is designed to provide real-time insights and a user-friendly experience. You can easily explore and visualize sales data.

# **Sales Forecasting** : Using advanced analytics techniques, I generated a sales forecasting report to help in future decision-making.

## How to Use:

2. **Dashboard** : The Power BI dashboard is in the `dashboard` folder. You can open it with Power BI Desktop.
